This is a new file I created using touch :D

Memes take so long to find, 
but thats something I can apprecate, 
so thank you Ofego, I appreciate your memes.

I added a couple of my own too :D

After searching for some fresh new memes, there isnt alot of time left,
so I guess there isnt that much to read afterall.
However I think youll be happy to hear that i'm getting more confident
or familiar with git :D which was the whole point of this, so good job :)

This was good I think, though i'm still not exactly confident with more advanced commands,
like branching or merging, I think this was well worthwile to practice.
I will be practicing over the weekend too :)
Thanks for the quiz, this is my last commit.
