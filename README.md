Enjoy the process and the meme :D

Hi Ofego!
This is my first commit(for the quiz, ive done commits before) :)

I assume it is Ofego reading this, otherwise it might be a bit awkward :/
Anyways, this is my second commit

If it is Ofego reading all this, 
1. I apologise in advance, I plan on using the entire 1.5hrs to experiment, writing new messages and seeing what else VsCode is capable of holding (Images, possibly videos?)
2. I hope you feel better soon :)
So this is my third commit :D

Nevermind, im not entirely sure how to/if you can get images/videos onto VsCode, so Im going to just try and add them to the repository without putting them in here. 
This is my fourth commit
